title: Clippers
desc: Why I care about design

For a short time in middle school, I had the most amazing nail clipper. Ridiculous, I know, but hold on a bit and you’ll see what I mean.

My mom bought them, I think, and left them in the bathroom. When I asked her what the deal was with their weird shape, she told me casually that they caught your clippings as you used them: no mess. Obviously there’s no miracle here—just a small metal tray attached to the clipper—but I was mesmerized.

As a kid, and into adolescence, I was not much into sports or music or other people (the latter two have been growing interest recently; still no interest in kicking a ball around though). But I was obsessed with how things worked. Yes, like many tinkerers of my generation, I was weaned on Lego[^1] and spent countless hours building everything from RC cars to, at age 10, with help from my dad, a desktop computer from scratch (with 512 MB of RAM, good lord).

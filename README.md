# Honors in the Arts Project

This is a staging ground for the hypertext novel I'm writing as part of [Stanford's Honors in the Arts](https://arts.stanford.edu/for-students/academics/honors-in-the-arts/) program. Just drafts here now, and [an easy way to read and engage with them](https://alecglassford.github.io/hia). The end product will look very different.

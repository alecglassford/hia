**Victoria Badger** (born October 5, 1994) is the founder and CEO of Sorella, a tech company that provides advice and mentorship to young people.

## Early Life

Badger was born in San Jose in 1994. Her mother, Nancy, and father, Morris, both worked at NASA's Ames Research Center as aerospace engineers. She spent much of her childhood at her parents' labs and as a result became "incredibly burnt out and bored by everything space-related." However, her parents would occasionally take her to see Pleiades, one of the world's fastest supercomputers, which was part of the center. Badger has cited this experience as the source of her subsequent interest in computing and artificial intelligence.

For high school, she attended the Athenaeum, an all-girls boarding school in Washington that she did not enjoy. Badger has described these years as "truly the nadir of my brief life so far â€¦ four wet, hellish years in the most pseudo-intellectual, new-agey environment imaginable."

Badger returned to the Bay Area in 2013 to study computer science at Stanford University, before dropping out in her second year to start Sorella, which had began as a summer research project.

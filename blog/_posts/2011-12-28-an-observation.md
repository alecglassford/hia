title: An Observation
desc: Just realized the smallest thing

Why I never before noticed this in my 17 years, I cannot fathom, but: New Year's Day is always exactly 1 week after Christmas. Doesn't matter what day of the week they're on, doesn't matter if it's a leap year, doesn't matter. It's an obvious thing, but never something I thought about.

And so what you get there is exactly 1 week out of 52, a magical week of no responsibilities for the world. Well, for me at least. I used to wish for a White Christmas, when I was little. But now this week of California sun feels reeeaaal nice. For the first time in a long time, for just this little bit, I feel a word that I rarely think about, a strange but wonderful word: c-a-r-e-f-r-e-e.

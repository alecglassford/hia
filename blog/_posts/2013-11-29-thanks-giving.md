When I decided to go to college in the Bay Area, I told my parents that even though I was so closet to home, I didn't want to be spending every weekend with them. I've achieved this goal pretty successfully: my mother brought me a few things from home, and I went out to dinner with my parents once when my aunt and uncle were in town, but that's it.

So Thanksgiving has been really … something. I get a week off from school and hoped to spend as much of it as possible getting ahead on coding projects for the rest of the term—the intro class that I'm required to take for the major certainly isn't difficult, but it has taken plenty of time nonetheless, and I have plenty of other coursework to worry about too, ranging from the trivial (physics) to the wonderful (a grad HCI seminar—nobody seemed to care that I'm a freshman).

But anyway, I had hoped to just bury[^1] myself into studying for the first part of the week in the absence of the distractions of classes, friends, etc. However, my dear mother has insisted that this is "a time for family," never mind that she was working Monday through Wednesday and that we never have Thanksgiving with any "family" outside of me, her, and my dad. Thus I have spent most of the last few days in the living room with my dad watching TV[^2] and working on a 12,000 piece jigsaw puzzle of a snow leopard in a mountain pass in a sleet storm.[^3]

It's so curious to me that my dad has developed an obsession with jigsaw puzzles in retirement. Tired of NASA, he has found an entirely lo-fi hobby to occupy himself with. That said, he brings an engineer's mindset to it: he has applied different strategies to his puzzle solving—sort by color, sort by shape; start with the biggest shapes, start with the smallest possible, ones—and for each puzzle he logs a multitude of data that includes the # of pieces, the strategies used, and the time spent completing it. For the snow leopard, we sorted all the pieces by shape before we placed any into the puzzle. Then we built the outer frame. Then he made a list of minimal polygons and assigned them one by one to either himself or to me. First we did boulders (outlines still distinct despite being covered with snow) and the leafless branches of trees. Then we did the green eyes, then the face of the leopard, followed by its fluffy ink-tipped tail, then its feet, which disappear into a snowbank, then the rest of its outline. Then the outline of the valley itself—the horizon is pretty impossible toward the middle though, so we left a gap. Now we're doing the leopard's spots. And once we finish those, we'll do the sky, focusing first on the specks of sleet that cross multiple jigsaw pieces. Of course that's about 60% (~7,200) of the puzzle that's basically just shades of grey, which he'll have to finish after I leave.

It's a ridiculous puzzle, but I can't say I don't find some meditative[^4] value to this process.

On occasion, I've been able to get out my laptop and nest into the couch next to my dad and work on school stuff, but eventually he'll ask me in his sweet dad voice to "Give me a hand here, honey," and I'll have to help out with the puzzle or else feel like a terrible daughter.

Every once in a while, he'll pause, gaze over the puzzle, and say something like, "Boy, isn't this a beautiful scene?" The answer is obviously no, but I just murmur.

I asked him if he had ever thought about traveling to the Himalayas to actually see a snow leopard[^5] since he was so moved by it and he just laughed.

"When you're old like me, pretty much anything can be moving." He's not actually that old though; he just retired because he was tired of his job and my parents don't need two source of income anymore.[^6] He's supposedly working on a book about his time working on ICBM design for the government in the last years of the Cold War, but it seems to me like he mostly just does puzzles.

Which brings me back to now: I'm nested in the corner of the couch and am getting away with some computer time because since my mom is off from work today my dad has roped her in as his #1 jigsaw assistant. They're actually kind of cute when they're working together on something trivial like this and not arguing about politics or their plans for the next 30 years or me or whatever else they like to go on about.

I've finished the last two assignments for my intro programming class while trying to ignore them and the TV's chatter, and I'm writing idly here to procrastinate from physics homework or writing my research proposal for Gordon Shu's lab[^7] or, god forbid, returning to the jigsaw puzzle. It's fine, but I have had just about enough. Dad has set a goal of 1,500 pieces for today, since we didn't get to work on it yesterday.

[^1]: Bury sounds negative, but I mean it in the most glorious way.

[^2]: He canceled cable over the summer, and mom and I wrote a program that pulls from feeds from YouTube, PBS, CNN, and a few others, then chooses the ones most tuned to my Dad's taste based on predefined keywords and also a machine learning rating based that uses keyword features. We hooked up a server that lives next to the TV and added an IR sensor set up so he can use the channel-up and -down keys on an old remote we have to vote for which videos he likes. At this point it's basically a mix of global politics, soccer, and clips from shitty Adam Sandler movies.

[^3]: I KNOW!! WHO COMES UP WITH THIS SHIT??

[^4]: Recently read an interesting article about [meditation's benefits for work/productivity](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/29/googles-jolly-good-fellow_n_3975944.html), among, obviously, other things.

[^5]: and get sleeted on

[^6]: With their mortgage paid off and their evident lack of desire to travel or, like, do anything fun, my parents have pretty much no expenses, which seems like a strange and boring place to be in life. Except for my tuition of course, but they opened a savings plan for my college when I was born and have fully paid into it over the years, which I realize makes me so, so ridiculously fortunate and privileged. And yet, in a way, makes my parents' lives so, so static and uninteresting. Strictly better than the financial insecurity, I suppose, but still.

[^7]: !!! I am of course over the moon about this, but am anxious about making the proposal perfect. I met with him last week and he seemed pretty enthusiastic about having me work on this chatbot stuff he and his grad students are doing; he just wants me to write something formal about what specifically I think I can contribute. I think (esp. after Couples Counselor) I'm most interested in working on generalizing way from domain-specificity. As long as bots are niche, no matter how useful they may be, they'll always appear to users to some extent as simply a veneer over a computer interface. But if they can be generalized, even if this means accepting some flaws in understanding and the verisimilitude of natural language generation, I think they can come across as more … human, I guess. Real people are bad at a lot of things, not good at one. I have a feeling that this exploring in this direction can unlock more of the true potential of bots.

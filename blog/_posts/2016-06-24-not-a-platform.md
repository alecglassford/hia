title: Sorella is not a platform
desc: Period.
---
Recently, a lot of people, especially in the press, have described Sorella as a "platform": a "platform" for information, a "platform" for young people to learn about themselves or express themselves, etc., etc.

This is an absurd turn of phrase.

Sorella is not a platform. Sorella is a chatbot. You could plausibly say that Sorella is a tool, or—if you want to be edgy or start of argument—a person. As wonderfully wild and tenuous as that would be, I think anybody could understand the basis of thinking behind the claim. But *platform*? Not a platform. Never a platform. It's [not even wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong).

Sorella exists in the context of many platforms. You can talk to her on Facebook Messenger, over text message, through WeChat, or, yes, through our own app and website as of last week. But even though you might make the case that this last instance is a platform, the way you access Sorella is not central to users' experience with her. This is not to disparage the incredible speedy and careful work of the teams who built out these systems—they have labored from the beginning of these projects to emphasize the key experience of Sorella: your individual conversation with the chatbot. No bells or whistle. Insofar as it exists at all, the platform is only in service of a specific, encompassing experience.

Many of you might think that this piece of linguistics is a small point to harp on. You'd be right. But in representing the significant, world-bettering work the amazing Sorella team is doing, I feel compelled amid all the big picture, more obviously mattering stuff, to pay some attention to small things like this when they touch so fundamentally on the core of what we're doing.

The big problem with the use of the word "platform," beyond its afactuality, is that reveals the weakness of imagination that pervades our industry—in the press, investors, and technologists alike. Just because some of the most significant developments in the technology over the past 20 years have been platforms—and rightfully so!—doesn't mean that next big thing should fit into this same mold. Sorella is something new. Our users—now numbering over 100,000—can tell you that without a doubt.

Silicon Valley thinks of itself as innovative, iconoclastic, nimble. And this is all true, to some extent; it would be foolish to deny it. But then there are the moments that remind an entrepreneur that even this community sitting at the bleeding edge of the progress is blind to the idea that shines so brightly in our mind—and it's these moments that light a fire under us and get us moving. When I say that Sorella is changing the way we connect, grow, and live as social animals, it is not simply to make myself feel good or to try to market this company with flashy words (though these are of course nice and necessary side effects for my ego and our business). It comes from a deep conviction. And I am so excited and joyful that we get to show you what we mean.

On a side note, the weakness of imagination that I've alluded to here is a cousin of the weaknesses that have kept the Valley's workforce looking so much the same for so many years now. At Sorella, we understand the need for change and we're not afraid of it, so keep your eye out for information about a new diversity initiative I'll be announcing in the next couple of weeks.

title: Santa Cruz, it's been so long
desc: I'll try to come back sooner this time.

Wind. Wind. Wind.

The road is triply winding[^1], more than triply, seemingly infinitely, bending in and in and in again on itself. I'm sitting up front to help with my motion sickness, but still it all twists, the swatches of green and brown and red[^2] flowing by, and my stomach feels like it's twisting too (because, of course, it is). It doesn't help that Jess is not exactly the world's best driver.

"The car's fuel efficiency is inversely proportional to how much I use the break" she says and brings us  loosely around another curve. It's a two lane road.

I've connected my phone to the speakers and am playing Ada and the Frigatebirds, partly because I want to share their music with my new friends, partly to have a point of focus—an activity and locus of conversation that I can control: no unexpected hilariousness or gross anecdotes that will precipitate vomit.

Jess seems pretty into Ada, or else she's being generous with her facial expressions. Vee is not so much of a fan[^3]. I look back and he's gazing blankly out the window. He asks if he can play some podcast after this song. I tell him that the instrumentation of the song ("Thanksgiving in the Lowlands") was decided with an algorithm: Ada and the Frigatebirds give it keywords of what type of song they were interested in making (e.g. genre, mood, imagery), and it finds songs that have been tagged with those keywords in a music database and gives back the instruments most used in those songs (with some random exploration thrown in), together with a recommendation of how much they should feature in the new song—in this case xylophone (primary), acoustic guitar (secondary), trumpet (tertiary). Ada then composes the song with these instruments.[^4] Vee cocks an eyebrow and asks why they don't just choose their own instruments.

"Constraints can motivate creativity!" Jess says[^5].

I agree, but also add that I don't necessarily see this algorithm-assisted instrumentation as a constraint. Instead, I like to think about how there are a million choices to make in writing a piece of music[^6] and by outsourcing part of that process to a computer program you're allowing a different perspective into the music, adding the creative thoughtfulness of the hundreds of thousands of people who wrote the songs in the database, who tagged them, who created the computer program in the first place (in this case, Ada herself, making it difficult to argue that the band is really relinquishing their own creativity at all[^7]). And all this combined could perhaps be described as the computer's own thoughtfulness, in a way, as the same type of decision-making could not have come from any of the individual people who created, or even a group of them: the computer gives us something greater than the sum of its parts, in a way.

So this process could be constraining, or it could make the music writing process easier—both interesting effects—but the most fascinating thing to me is the inclusion of the inclusion of the other consciousnesses.

I say all this, more or less [^8], and Vee and Jess nod and hmm thoughtfully, and I can tell they're not just humoring me and that they are genuinely interested, but also they're not totally on board with what I'm saying. That's okay; I'm just so happy to get to talk about these ideas that spend so much time bouncing across my brain. And it's all sufficient distraction from my nausea. We are quiet for the rest of the song[^9], and we listen to Vee's podcast for the rest of the ride.

Santa Cruz is foggy[^10], and we just barely find parking and make it to the movie before it starts. The small theater is almost empty and the movie is *dry as hell*. The director is some student of Yang Fudong, which we were all excited about, but it should have led us to foresee that the movie would be a lot of people walking around quietly and occasionally making eye contact. Every once in a while a scene that's already happened is repeated in a different city, which is kind of cool.

Vee gets popcorn on the way out of the theater since we didn't get a chance when we rushed in.[^11] The fog has burned off and it's not quite sunset yet, so we walk down to the boardwalk. I've been here before, but not since I was like five or six. It's a little disappointing tbh, the whole thing a bit too old-timey for me. You can't even see the sunset over the Pacific because of the angle the beach is at—it's actually setting over the land instead, which seems not optimally idyllic.

But then again. The light is still that low-in-the-sky light, and it's actually pretty comfortable dispite the wind, and it's a strange joy to hear my friends debate the film we just saw.[^12]

Which is all to say: this is a really good day. This is a day I don't want to forget, but I know my flimsy memory will begin losing it as soon as it happens, indeed has already begun corrupting it all by the time we begin the car ride back and I am overwhelmed again by queasiness.[^13] So I will procrastinate a little the next day from all the homework I ought to do, and write it all down in the hope of having something perhaps a little more real.[^14]

[^1]: Did you pronounce it with a short i in the first paragraph?
[^2]: The tallest trees in the world!
[^3]: Vee, if you read this, well, oops that's a little embarrassing for me, but also your feelings about Ada do not affect my judgement of your character. Not very much.
[^4]: With some artistic license. I read in [an interview](LINK) that she added percussion to this song because she felt it needed it, even though the algorithm didn't recommend it.
[^5]: Jess really does speak with exclamation points a lot of the time.
[^6]: or making any art or doing any thing
[^7]: though relinquishing creativity isn't an inherently negative thing, I don't think
[^8]: in far less thought out words, tbh
[^9]: The trumpet solo at the end is spectacular, regardless of what you think of the writing process.
[^10]: oy, was expecting a bit of a beach day as much as anything else
[^11]: Jess: "They mark that stuff up like 900%! Just buy some at the grocery store!"
[^12]: Jess: "The onslaught of changing settings amplifies the characters' journey by emphasizing their sense of dislocation!" Vee: "There was *literally* no narrative."
[^13]: I am too shy to make any asks of the fragilely built new friendship, but Jess if you read this: drive a little slower next time? Just around the corners maybe.
[^14]: [And thus.](#)

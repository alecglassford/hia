"This weekend is the perfect time to get laid! It's been a while."

"Cure your hangover from your wild Friday night with a walk to that new juice bar on your block."

"After a long all-day hike this Saturday, kick back with a beer or two in your backyard, balcony, or roof—it's supposed to stay unseasonably hot into the evening!"

These are just a few of the activities that the popular chatbot Party Fowl has been recommending to kids—stirring up plenty of unwanted controversy for the year-old startup. The company launched publicly in November with their chatbot that gathers information about users through conversation each week and then recommends what they should do with their weekends.

While Party Fowl, like most other websites, requires its users to be at least 13 years old, it does not appear to make distinctions in its recommendations based on age. Recently teenagers (and their parents) have started complaining to social media about age-inappropriate advice that it's been sending them. The tips allude to sex and alcohol in ways that might seem unremarkable, if a occasionally off-color, if they had been communicated to adults, but can come across as creepy when sent to minors.

As you'd imagine, some teens have considered these messages a source of humor:

> Lol - @PartyFowl just told me to get laid this weekend. Clearly it does not know what it is like to be a sophomore in high school. #imtrying

Others were more sketched out. And parents were almost universally outraged:

> Um a cartoon chicken/robot/corporation just told me that I should be having more sex. I'm 16. wtf @PartyFowl

> I DO NOT need @PartyFowl telling my son to "pop open a beer" !! As if there aren't enough bad influences around these days. smh, our family have been users of this "fun" app, but no longer.

**Update (8pm) :** Party Fowl CEO Marcus Pim responded to our request for an interview with an email statement that read,

>We have been alarmed at the reports of inappropriate recommendations being provided to minors by Party Fowl. Our company has always strived to create a product that brings joy and meaning to users from a variety of backgrounds, including form a range of ages, but for now we have stopped Party Fowl from communicating with users under 21, until we can implement proper safeguards to ensure age-appropriate communication. This was an oversight on our part, and we apologize sincerely if we have caused anyone offense. We hope to show in the coming weeks that Party Fowl can still be a positive force in people's difficult lives.

Pim has canceled his keynote presentation at the 2016 BotFest conference in Palo Alto this weekend.

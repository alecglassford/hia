The Calico Bletchley-backed startup Party Fowl released their recommendation chatbot into public beta yesterday. The app aims to help indecisive users choose how to spend their time on the weekend. Despite the name, Party Fowl recommends not only parties to its users, but also concerts, movies, and many other types of community events. It also recommends more general activities like "go for a run" or "visit a friend you haven't seen in a long time" or "get coffee and read a book by the window."

Party Fowl, a chatbot that interacts through multiple services, messages users throughout the week and asks them what they are up to at work and after work, as well as how they are feeling. It also asks about personal data like users' demographic information and what types of activities they enjoy most. Fed by this continual stream of conversation with users, every Friday it will recommend an itinerary of several activities for the weekend.

"We are living in a world of abundant choice," Party Fowl CEO Marcus Pim said at the company's launch party in Golden Gate Park. "Party Fowl is here to help people make the best possible choices to fill their lives with joyful and fulfilling experiences."

The company is currently operating on at $50 million investment from Calico Bletchley, but Pim revealed the long-term plan is to monetize by building in opportunities for sponsors for their events to be recommended more frequently.

"People today crave experiences over products," Pim said, "and companies know that experiences are the best way way to reach consumers. This applies if you're a musician and you want fans to come to your show, but we can also see it in action if we imagine a sports drink company recommending you go play a game of pick-up soccer with some buddies."

Party Fowl is avaialble for free on most messaging platforms now.

Victoria Badger understands the how hard marriage can be. So, like many entrepreneurial tech whizzes these days, she made an app for that. But unlike most people working to help you and your spouse mend your relationship, Badger is just 17.

Her app, Couples Counselor (“I’m still working on the name”), allows both members of the couple to fill out a questionnaire describing what they’re frustrated about in the relationship. Then, it provides suggestions on launching-off points for a productive conversation. The couple then follows up in the app, each reporting how satisfied they were with the conversation, and after answering more questions, the process repeats.

“Sometimes people just need a little help to get started,” Badger said. The high school senior, currently enrolled at the prestigious Athenaeum boarding school and planning to attend Stanford University in the fall, created the app for the University of Washington’s first annual Human-Centric High School Coding Contest (HCHSCC), where Couples Counselor won first prize. The prize included a $10,000 cash reward.

“This is one of the best uses of artificial intelligence I’ve seen in a long time, even better than much of the work my undergraduates do,” said Wendell Coveny, a professor of computer science at UW and one of the contest’s judges. “I look forward to seeing Victoria’s future work,” he said, before adding with a smile, “And I might make good use of this app at home!”

Cool idea, and of course it's great to see young people taking on ambitious new challenges. However. My girlfriend and I both downloaded the app and tried playing around with it. We haven't been having any issues with our relationship, but we thought it looked neat and were curious what kind of prompts it would give us. We both inputted information about our communication styles, our ages/other demographic details, and what the biggest difficulties of our relationship are (mostly talking about money and managing our joint finances). And then the app asked us to talk to each other about (in this order, no joke) our feelings about each other's religious practices, our sexual turn-ons and turn-offs, and our relationships with our parents. Maybe I'm missing some deep Freudian philosophy behind all this, but it seems to me like the algorithm might still need some fine-tuning. …

My wife and I have been arguing a lot lately. I saw this app, and during our most recent fight, I suggested to her that we try downloading it. She went to stay at her friend's place. :(
